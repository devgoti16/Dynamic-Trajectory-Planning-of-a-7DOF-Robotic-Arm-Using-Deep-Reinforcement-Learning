# Dynamic Trajectory Planning of a 7DOF Robotic Arm Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Description
This project implements dynamic trajectory planning for a 7 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. It aims to optimize the arm's movement path in real-time, considering various environmental constraints and task objectives.

## Features
- Dynamic trajectory planning for a 7DOF robotic arm
- Deep Reinforcement Learning implementation
- Real-time optimization of movement paths
- [Add more features specific to your project]

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/devgoti16/Dynamic-Trajectory-Planning-of-a-7DOF-Robotic-Arm-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Dynamic-Trajectory-Planning-of-a-7DOF-Robotic-Arm-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

3. Install the required dependencies:
## Installation Guide using Conda

This guide will help you set up the project environment using Conda and install all necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system. If not, download and install from [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### Steps to create the environment and install dependencies

1. Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows).

2. Create a new Conda environment named "myrosenv":
conda create --name myrosenv python=3.7

3. Activate the newly created environment:
   conda activate myrosenv
4. Install pip inside the Conda environment (if not already installed):
   conda install pip

5. Navigate to the directory containing your `requirements.txt` file.

6. Install the required packages using pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Verify the installation by listing the installed packages:
   pip list
### Using the environment

- To activate the environment in the future, use:
conda activate myrosenv
- To deactivate the environment when you're done, use:
conda deactivate

Note: If you encounter any issues during installation, ensure that both Conda and pip are up to date:
conda update conda
pip install --upgrade pip
