# Dynamic Trajectory Planning of a 7DOF Robotic Arm Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Description
This project implements dynamic trajectory planning for a 7 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. It aims to optimize the arm's movement path in real-time, considering various environmental constraints and task objectives.

## Features
- Dynamic trajectory planning for a 7DOF robotic arm
- Deep Reinforcement Learning implementation
- Real-time optimization of movement paths
